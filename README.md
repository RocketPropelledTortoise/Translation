__Work In Progress, do not use in production__

This package is a bundle for Laravel 4 applications.

It extends the base `Translation` Service Provider and stores the language in database.

## `//Todo`

- Rename the tables
- Add migrations for the tables
- Actually extend the LangServiceProvider (is separated for the moment)
- Support both files and database sources
- Better separation in classes
- Remove all CodeIgniter references (was built for CodeIgniter before)
- Document
- Test

A second package `translation-ui` is also in the pipes to provide an administration interface for all the strings
